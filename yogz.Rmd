## Yoga mat bag

I crocheted a yoga mat bag *years* ago. It is cylinder-shaped with a shoulder strap. While it works pretty well, I always wished the `radius` was a bit larger so I didn't have to roll the mat so tightly to get it to fit. This is my attempt at using *R* to design a bigger and better crocheted yoga mat bag. 

The 'ggplot2' package will help visualize, so I will begin by adding that.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

The bag is started by making a circle for the bottom of the cylinder. The old bag started with a circle of 12 stitches. To expand on this, I crocheted circles around it, adding 12 stitches for every round.
